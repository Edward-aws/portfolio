# Edward Gonzales Portfolio

This is my professional portfolio which uses AWS and react


# Technologies Used

1. Git

Added git to my code which will help with versioning control

2. S3

Created 2 buckets in S3; one to host my website and the other to use for my code build which I used later on

3. Cloud Front/SSL Route 53

Created a cloud front Distrubiton and created an SSL certificate for my domain.

4. Python Scripts

Created a python script which automatically pushes my code to git and aws when I run a command rather than manually updating the s3 folders

5. Lambda

Created a Lambda function which will run my script automatically when I make a commit and notify me if it deployed successfully via email. I will not have to manually run the script command in my terminal.

6. Code build

Created a code build job which will automatically update my code on git and in AWS when I make a commit to Git



7. Code Pipeline

Implemented Code Pipeline to successfully manage and view the protfolio Projects
